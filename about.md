Hey there! I'm Hannah, a recent graduate of [UC Berkeley](http://www.me.berkeley.edu/). While at Berkeley, I was involved in [acts2fellowship](http://www.a2fberkeley.org/) and worked at [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com), [Tyvak](www.tyvak.com), and [ReMaterials](wwww.modroof.in). For the next year, I will (tentatively) be helping out at [Klesis@CMU](https://cmu.klesis.org/) as a Church Plant Intern(CPI) and blogging about my experiences.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing, and attempting to play volleyball! 

You can contact me at hannahling@berkeley.edu.
