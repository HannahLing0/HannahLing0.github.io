The past week has been a whirlwind! From Saturday to Friday, my family and I went camping in Tuolomne Meadows, Yosemite. We went to a bunch of awesome hikes and destinations including Cloud's Rest, Cathedral Lakes, Mono Pass, Lambert Dome, and Lower Yosemite Falls. It was a lot of fun(although we got on each others' nerves occasionally, and it was difficult living conditions with a lot of mosquitos, a lot of dirt, and no showers). 

Right now, I'm staying at one of my peers' houses with O, my CPI partner who's also going to CMU. It's so weird after years of living in a dinky apartment to have a house with our own washer and dryer, and TONS of space and walk-in closet! There are 6 of us at this house right now, and 6 more at our other house just down the street. Today we had 9 people for dinner and it was a happy time. 

On Friday and Saturday, we did Members orientation to become a member of Gracepoint church and New Intern orientation. Those were mostly going through different standard expectations about being an intern and logistical things. Today, we had Members Bible Study as well as attended the worship service with the college students/college staff.

Then, we had a short meeting where Pastor Ed and Kelly encouraged us to become good at receiving feedback(essential for living in really close proximity and constant interaction with each other) and answered logistics questions. It's been really fun to meet the other CPIs coming in from Davis, Austin, Riverside, Irvine, Los Angeles, and Santa Barbara! 

Our official send-off date is **8/6!!!!** Until then, our training goes from 7AM-10PM every day and consists of some kind of content, cleaning, cooking training, life skills training, exercising, and Bible reading! We'll also be doing Joyworld on Fridays and helping out with the Element High School and Middle School retreats. 

Really excited! Next couple weeks will be really busy.

Cheers,
Hannah
